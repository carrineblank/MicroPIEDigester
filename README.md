# MicroPIEDigester
A Coded Phenotypic Character Matrix Generator, version 1.0 (released Feb 23, 2017).

MicroPIEDigester is a perl script that converts raw phenotypic character information generated by MicroPIE (Microbial Phenomic Information Extractor; https://github.com/biosemantics/micropie2).  The Digester codes the raw phenotypic information into characters and character states, extracting both discrete and continuous character types, and outputs nexus files formatted for Mesquite (http://mesquiteproject.org/).  In the process of character coding, it uses the standard vocabulary and synonyms of terms established in MicrO (An Ontology of Prokaryotic Phenotypic and Metabolic Characters; https://github.com/carrineblank/MicrO/) to ontologize raw phenotypic characters into character states.

Created in September through October of 2016 by Carrine E. Blank, University of Montana.

MicroPIEDigester is invoked at the command line by typing 'perl MicroPIEDigester.pl infile' where the infile is a character matrix in text format.

MicroPIEDigester version 1.0 was created to code character information for the Bacteroidetes.  Characters types are:
median mol %g+c
cell shape
mean cell length
max cell length
mean cell width
max cell width
cell relationships&aggregations
gram stain type
internal features
motility
pigment compounds
nacl minimum
nacl optimum
nacl maximum
ph minimum

aerophilicity
magnesium requirement for growth
vitamins and cofactors required for growth
antibiotic sensitivity
antibiotic resistant
colony shape

haemolytic&haemadsorption properties
organic compounds used or hydrolyzed
organic compounds not used or not hydrolyzed
